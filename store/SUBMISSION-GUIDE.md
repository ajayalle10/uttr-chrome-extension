# How to publish Uttr to the free extension stores

All three stores are **free** to join. Each needs its own account, and you'll submit in each one separately.

**Before you start, download these two files** from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ajayalle10/uttr-chrome-extension/releases/latest):
- `uttr.zip`: for **Edge** and **Opera** (and Chrome later)
- `uttr-firefox.zip`: for **Firefox** only

Keep [`LISTING.md`](LISTING.md) open in another tab. Every text field below is copied from there. The images are in this [`store/`](.) folder.

> ℹ️ Store websites change their layouts from time to time, so a button may be worded slightly differently from what's written here. The steps stay the same.

   - Compatible platforms: tick **Firefox**. Leave **Firefox for Android** unticked for now, since it hasn't been tested on phones yet.

5. **Describe your add-on:**
   - Name: `Uttr`

   - Category: **Language Support** (or **Other**)

## After approval ✅

1. **Try your own listing**: install Uttr from each store on your own computer.
2. **Send the store links to Claude** so "Get it on Edge / Firefox / Opera" buttons can be added to the README.
3. **Share them!** Store links are one-click installs, much easier than the ZIP method.

## Releasing updates later

1. Make the changes and bump `"version"` in `manifest.json`, for example `0.1.2` → `0.2.0`.
2. Run `python scripts/build.py` to create fresh `dist/uttr.zip` and `dist/uttr-firefox.zip`.
3. Upload to each store:
   - **Edge:** open Uttr, go to **Packages**, **Replace**, then **Publish**
   - **Firefox:** open Uttr, go to **Upload New Version**
   - **Opera:** open Uttr, go to **Upload new version**
4. Updates are **free**. Users receive them automatically after review.

## If a review is rejected

The store emails you the reason. Common ones, and what to do:
- **"Broad host permissions"**: reply with the permission justification from `LISTING.md`. Uttr needs to work on every site because you can select text anywhere.
- **"Missing privacy policy"**: make sure the privacy policy URL or text was added.
- Anything else: paste the message to Claude and we'll fix it together.
